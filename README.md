## Laravel API for Car Parking App

## What we're creating here

Imagine a mobile app to park the car somewhere in a big city, to start/stop the parking.

Let's just quickly run through the features that our users would be able to do, those features will later become API endpoints. In a typical simple parking application, I imagine these

> features:

    -User register
    -User login
    -User view/update profile/password
    -Manage user's vehicles
    -Get prices for parking zones/areas
    -Start/stop parking at a chosen zone
    -View the current/total price of parking

## Notice:

> In this application, we will skip the actual payments for parking, because there are so many different ways to pay, depending on the country, so that could be a separate very long course, in the future.
